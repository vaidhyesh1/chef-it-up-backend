<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Cooking is a necessary survival skill that we use in our everyday lives. One of the most common challenges with
    cooking is deciding what to make. Often, this can lead to people spending hours on the internet to find something
    that aligns with what they like to cook/eat. This can be tedious and lead to people choosing something thatâ€™s easy
    to make rather than trying something interesting.</p>

<p>Chef-it-Up aims to eliminate this cumbersome process of finding a recipe that you are comfortable making by bringing
    the recipes to you. We want to map user preferences like their choice of ingredients, preferred cooking methods,
    etc. to create tailor-made recipe recommendations for the users. These recommendations can benefit all people, from
    amateur cooks to expert chefs.</p>

<p>Our goal is to make the process of choosing a recipe easy, so users can spend their time cooking rather than looking
    for a dish to cook.</p>

<h2 id="2-proposed-solution-methods-used">2. Proposed Solution / Methods Used</h2>

<p>To develop Chef-It-Up, we used a combination of machine learning algorithms and user-centric design principles. The
    platform consists of the following components:</p>

<ul>
    <li>User Profile: Users create a profile that includes their search history and followers.</li>
    <li>Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes based on their preferences and dietary requirements. </li>
    <li>User Feedback: Users can rate recipes and chefs, providing feedback to improve the platform&#39;s
        recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-conclusions">4. Conclusions</h2>

<p>In conclusion, Chef-it-Up has successfully achieved its goal of making the process of choosing a recipe easy for
    users. By mapping user preferences and leveraging machine learning algorithms, we were able to provide tailor-made
    recipe recommendations that suit each user&#39;s unique tastes. Our platform has the potential to benefit all
    individuals, from amateur cooks to expert chefs, by simplifying the recipe selection process and saving valuable
    time.</p>

<p>Throughout the development process, we focused on user-centric design principles and utilized the latest technologies
    to create a user-friendly and efficient platform. </p>

<p>As we look towards the future, we plan to continue improving and expanding the platform, incorporating new features
    and functionalities that will further enhance the user experience. Chef-it-Up has the potential to revolutionize the
    way people approach cooking and eating, and we are excited to see the impact it will have in the culinary world.</p>
